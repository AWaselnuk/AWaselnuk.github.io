# What I am up to right now

*Last updated May, 2019*

* Working at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) as a Staff Developer. The current project is a marketplace that will connect our partners who provide services with our merchants.
* Preparing for daughter number 3. She arrives in July and I'll be taking the summer off for paternity leave.
* Learning how to use a longsword at [Ottawa Swordplay](https://ottawaswordplay.com/) based on the [Liechtenauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer) tradition.
* Investing lots of energy into my new home which we moved into in August of last year. It is my first time owning a house and I love it!
* Trying to form new habits focused on physical conditioning. If you have any tips, please let me know.
* Learning how people build self-funded businesses by listening to podcasts and reading books.
* Reading [The Brothers Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov) which is my first Dostoevsky novel.
