# What I am up to right now

_Last updated Nov, 2022_

I'm always happy to take meetings with people to discuss tech entrepreneurship, product, or the gaming industry. [Send me an email if you want to chat.](mailto:adam.waselnuk@gmail.com)

- Building a platform to help people create, play, and share mobile RPGs. Currently in the early design and research phase.
- Learning about fundraising which I've never done before but now need to do to build my vision.
- Running tabletop RPG websites from my company [Sword & Source](https://swordandsource.ca). The most popular one is [Here Be Taverns](https://herebetaverns.com) which generates content for Game Masters using generative AI, markov chains, and simple array shuffling.
- Studying game design, especially in relation to collaborative virtual worlds, tabletop RPGs, and mobile gaming.
- Studying game dev, especially ECS architecture, roguelike techniques, and whether or not I should be using the web platform.
- Preparing for the winter in Ontario.
- Reading the Scholomance trilogy.
- Watching Breaking Bad again.
