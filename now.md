# What I am up to right now

_Last updated Aug, 2022_

I'm always happy to take meetings with people to discuss tech entrepreneurship, products, partnerships, and the TTRPG/Gaming industry. [Send me an email if you want to chat.](mailto:adam.waselnuk@gmail.com)

- Thinking about what's next. [Should we collaborate?](/collaborate)
- Running some Tabletop RPG websites from [Sword & Source](https://swordandsource.ca), a company I created.
- Hiking as much as possible.
- Studying game design, especially in relation to collaborative virtual worlds.
- Reading books on game design, narrative system design, and story structure.
- Watching What we do in the shadows on Disney+.
- Testing [CODEOWNERS.com](https://codeowners.com)
