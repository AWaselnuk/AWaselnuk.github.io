_Last updated May, 2022_

- Looking for my next thing. [Let's collaborate.](/collaborate)
- Running some Tabletop RPG websites from [Sword & Source](https://swordandsource.ca), a company I created.
- Reading Storyworthy and some H.G. Wells.
- Hiking as much as possible.
- Studying marketing and the business side of Saas.
