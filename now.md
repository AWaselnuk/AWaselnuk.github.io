# What I am up to right now

_Last updated Sep, 2023_

I'm always happy to take meetings with people to discuss tech entrepreneurship, product, or the gaming industry. [Send me an email if you want to chat.](mailto:adam.waselnuk@gmail.com)

- Building the team and early product at [Storycraft - a platform for gamers to create and play unique stories with AI](https://www.storycraft.gg). Currently in early prototyping phase.
- Maintaining tabletop RPG websites from my company [Sword & Source](https://swordandsource.ca). The most popular one is [Here Be Taverns](https://herebetaverns.com) which generates content for Game Masters using generative AI, markov chains, and simple array shuffling.
- Studying game design, especially in relation to collaborative virtual worlds, tabletop RPGs, and mobile gaming.
- Studying systems design for scalable multiplayer web games.
