# Bootstrapper Milestones

Bootstrapped founders hit many milestones on their journey towards a sustainable business. It's important to remember and celebrate them because the road is long and interesting.

I'll keep track of my milestones here:

## Up Next

- Sell my first digital product
- Achieve "break-even MRR (~$100)". This is enough monthly revenue to pay for the costs of the services I use to run the business.
