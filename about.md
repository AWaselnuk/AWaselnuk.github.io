# About me

I blend experience in UX design, full stack web development, and teaching, into a technical leadership role that is ideal for digital product teams. As a Developer Lead at Shopify, I have learned to build teams and navigate the challenges of a company that is scaling fast (I joined Shopify when it was around 700 employees).

On the technical side of things, I specialize in front-end web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I have also built a solid foundation in Ruby/Rails and Object Oriented Programming. I am currently focused on learning to scale myself as a technical lead and learning more about software design and architecture.

Here are some things I care a lot about and would love to discuss with you:

* The challenges of communication and execution at large scale software companies
* Leading teams of developers
* Programming literacy
* Self-directed education and homeschooling
* Resisting the attention economy (e.g. http://humanetech.com/)
* Software design and architecture
* Keeping democracy intact
* Magic, fantasy, and the importance of play

Here are some technologies I know:
Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Typescript, React, HTML, CSS, Git, The internet

Here are some technologies I have tried and enjoyed using:
Angular, Coffeescript, React Native, Node, Elixir, Elm
