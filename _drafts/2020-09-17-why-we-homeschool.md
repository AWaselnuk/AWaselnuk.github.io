**THIS PIECE NEEDS A SHINY DIME: What is the central thing that will help me avoid trying to write everything about the topic in one article"**

It was fall 2015?? My wife Amanda and I sat beside each other in our small living room in downtown Ottawa. From where I sat, I could see the quirky stainglass window with a rose in it that faced the street. That room seems so small for us now, but at the time it was the perfect size. Amanda's eyes were pointed towards the ground, the direction they always look when she is deep in thought. We were sitting in a significant silence. Possibilities, questions, concerns were racing through both our heads and the mental effort seemed to take up the whole room. It came from a question:

"What if we _didn't_ send our kids to school?"

## Break

My memory of the moment exaggerates the emotional significance of the question. At the time it was, in truth, more trivial. But that small question lead to more questions. It lead to a deep investigation and a series of crucial conversations. It grew, and it grew, and it grew. Today, we understand that choosing to homeschool was one of the most valuable decisions we ever made. That simple, contrarian question lead us towards a deeper understanding of the education system, our children, and ourselves. Amanda and I were able to take it seriously because of an important principle we had already established: **life should be lived intentionally, not accidentally.**

## Start with self reflection

Our research began with the easiest subject: ourselves. The early conversation was a series of complaints about our own experiences in public schools. We both had a clear history of being bored for most of our time in classrooms. We are both agreeable by nature so we would do the bare minimum effort to get grades to please our parents and teachers. The rest of the time we would check out. In early school, we got in trouble for distracting other students with chatter. In the later years, I started smoking weed. As soon as I realized I could get away with being high in class it became my new normal. Five years of my life are lost in a haze. We were not engaged.

Looking back, more than 20 years of our life looked like a massive region of academic boredom punctuated with only a few useful highlights. Something like this:

Surely we learned something valuable? All that time was working towards something wasn't it?

No, not really. The most valuable lessons were a result of being curious humans interacting with other humans, not the public school curriculum.

There were definitely important teachers and subjects. There is no doubt that school offered a few diamonds in the rough. Even more valuable are the key relationships we remember. Learning to socialize is critical for everyone's development. But did it need to take 20 years? No. Did it have a big impact on where we are today? No. Memory selects for frequency and recency. It is telling that we forget almost everything we learned in the standard curriculum. I made it to second year university mathematics as part of my physics studies because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. Today, I can barely do long division. Studying hard in school then going to university did nothing for getting us a good job. I discovered a meaningful career in tech through self study and a return to college as an adult. Amanda never found a fulfilling career from school but discovered meaning as a mother and leader of our children's education.

Most of our intellectual highlights are from our own readings and conversations with friends. Something we did outside of school hours.

## Solidifying with research

This idea that "our kids will be homeschooled" is antifragile. In our experience, the more we try to poke holes in it, the stronger it gets. After our personal reflections made it clear that public school had wasted a lot of our time we moved to reading books on the topic. Our own personal experiences, while powerful, were not enough to determine the lives of our children. Surely there was a good reason this established institution was in place? What we discovered surprised us.

The psychologist Peter Gray sums it up nicely:

> “If we want to understand why standard schools are what they are, we have to abandon the idea that they are products of logical necessity or scientific insight. They are, instead, products of history.”

The Western public school system was born from an industrial-era set of employer interests to create a labour force that would succeed in a factory setting. Kids needed to learn to follow directions, be on time, and withstand long working hours. The physical layout of public schools was designed by the same people who designed prisons. The shape of the typical classroom makes it clear that the teacher is the undisputable authority.

More than a 100 years later and not much has changed in the core model. The current public school system is a result of inertia, the need for massive scale, and the near-impossibility of changing a [total institution](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED109817).

## Child developmental psychology

Children are natural learners. They spend all of their waking hours learning through play. Work VS play is a false dichotomy. Unfortunately we see it everywhere. Educational products and toys are marketed with messages such as "Kids will learn without even noticing!" or "Make learning fun!". The idea is embedded in everyone's minds. If you start looking for it, you will notice that parents speak in terms of "making" their kids learn. This bad idea has spawned an entire consumer category called "Edutainment".

The idea that work and play are separate is a direct result of the public school system. Of course learning is not fun when "learning" actually means sitting still in a classroom for an unreasonable number of hours waiting for the slowest kid in the room to understand a topic you don't even care about. Play is one of our primal needs. Children engage in free play in order to socialize and understand the world around them. Many modern classrooms actively suppress free play. Teachers have a difficult job and need to manage large groups of kids. Administrations fear liability. A classroom is a great way to meet friends and adopt the culture, but it is actively suppressing one of the most important social circuits.

Children are natural learners. As adults we don't need some grand design for them. We simply need to offer some guidance and invest in the areas our kids care about. We mostly need to just get out of their way. We believed that we could teach our kids some core basics such as, reading, writing, and math, and then let them guide the rest of their education. We believed that if we gave them exposure to many different experiences, they would have a natural interest in things. We would invest in the topics they showed interest in. By leveraging their natural instinct to learn, they would learn faster and go deeper. We would entirely avoid the adversarial arrangement where they don't want to study and we say they have to. We would learn together organically.

Another natural advantage outside the classroom is sequential, motivated learning. Contrast this with the classroom model which is parallel, dictated learning. At school you have a wide array of topics in the curriculum you are expected to progress on every year. An addition to the wide range, you have an arbitrary cutoff time each day. When the bell rings, you stop learning and switch contexts. If you are still behind you are given homework. Sometimes you just get homework anyway. If you are really enjoying yourself you have to stop. You get homework. Throughout the year you are making incremental progress on many things, regardless of interest or natural aptitude.

With homeschooling you can learn in sequence and focus on what motivates you. You can go deep on any topic. If your child is showing an interest in bugs, you can simply learn about bugs for a week. A compounding effect can kick in when the child is not forced to context switch at the ring of a bell. Worrying that they will fall behind in a topic is needless. Remember that children are natural learners. They are deeply interested in everything. Don't worry about forcing them to do their math sheet – just have them count the bugs.

This type of self-directed learning is not only a natural advantage for kids, it is the core competency of the future. In our information economy, the pace of societal change will continue to increase. Retraining will become the norm, rather than the exception. A child who grew up following their interests and teaching themselves will be powerful in such an environment. A child who expects to receive instruction from an authority figure or a standard curriculum will be left behind.

> Besides information, most schools also focus too much on providing students with a set of predetermined skills, such as solving differential equations, writing computer code in C++, identifying chemicals in a test tube, or conversing in Chinese. Yet since we have no idea what the world and the job market will look like in 2050, we don’t really know what particular skills people will need.

> "...schools should downplay technical skills and emphasize general-purpose life skills. Most important of all will be the ability to deal with change, learn new things, and preserve your mental balance in unfamiliar situations. To keep up with the world of 2050, you will need to do more than merely invent new ideas and products, but above all, reinvent yourself again and again."

## economic factors

Once you realize homeschooling is a compelling option, you bump up against one of the biggest challenges. A family's financial situation can often kill the idea before you ever get a chance to try it out. Choosing to homeschool, means choosing to have your kids at home all day. Instead of state-funded childcare, you have to be the primary guardian of your kids during regular business hours.

I acknowledge this is a _serious_ challenge. Many families simply cannot afford to go from two incomes down to one. Many people have jobs that won't offer the flexibility needed to make this happen. It's an incredibly difficult situation. My wife and I were lucky enough to completely sidestep this problem. I had moved into the tech industry and secured a long-term job that paid very well. Amanda had never found a fulfilling career and had been wasting her time doing crappy jobs that paid poorly. The choice was clear: Amanda would stay at home and become the primary caregiver of our children.

In some cases, it's not a matter of money but personal goals. Many people _do_ have careers they like and they imagine themselves going far. Our culture still has a ridiculous pattern of equating income level with overall success. It is a tough pill to swallow. Walking away from your hard-earned career goals to do something as humble as teaching and raising your kids every day.

I often think about what we would have done if the financial situation had not been so clearly solvable. Would one of us have dropped our career goals to pursue homeschooling? I like to think I would have done it if necessary. What could be more important than my children's daily education and quality of life? What could be more important than spending the most time possible with my children during there most formative years? If I'm being completely honest, I don't know if I would have done it. Looking back I have rose-coloured glasses. Knowing what I now know about homeschooling, I believe I would have dropped everything in an instant. But the truth is that we had much less conviction at the time we made the decision. The truth is I seek status just like everybody else. I take pride in appearing successful. I am selfish.

Public school is like a jobs program for adults.

## reversibility of the decision

When deciding whether to homeschool your kids, it can feel like a life-altering decision. It feels _heavy_, as if you are deciding their entire fate. This is a trap. Homeschooling is something you can simply _try_. It's not a lifelong commitment. Public school makes it very simple to enroll your kids at any age. If you try homeschooling, and it doesn't work for your family, you can stop doing it. It's a reversible decision.

Your employer will probably be happy to have you back. There will always be other job opportunities. Your children might need an adjustment period, but you know as well as I do that they adapt quickly to changing circumstances.
