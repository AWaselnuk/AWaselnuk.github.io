**THIS PIECE NEEDS A SHINY DIME: What is the central thing that will help me avoid trying to write everything about the topic in one article"**

It was fall 2015?? My wife Amanda and I sat beside each other in our small living room in downtown Ottawa. From where I sat, I could see the quirky stainglass window with a rose in it that faced the street. That room seems so small for us now, but at the time it was the perfect size. Amanda's eyes were pointed towards the ground, the direction they always look when she is deep in thought. We were sitting in a significant silence. Possibilities, questions, concerns were racing through both our heads and the mental effort seemed to take up the whole room. It came from a question:

"What if we _didn't_ send our kids to school?"

## Break

My memory of the moment exaggerates the emotional significance of the question. At the time it was, in truth, more trivial. But that small question lead to more questions. It lead to a deep investigation and a series of crucial conversations. It grew, and it grew, and it grew. Today, we understand that choosing to homeschool was one of the most valuable decisions we ever made. That simple, contrarian question lead us towards a deeper understanding of the education system, our children, and ourselves. Amanda and I were able to take it seriously because of an important principle we had already established: **life should be lived intentionally, not accidentally.**

## Start with self reflection

Our research began with the easiest subject: ourselves. The early conversation was a series of complaints about our own experiences in public schools. We both had a clear history of being bored for most of our time in classrooms. We are both agreeable so we would do the bare minimum effort to get grades to please our parents and teachers. The rest of the time we would check out. In early school, we go in trouble for distracting other students with chatter. In the later years, I started smoking weed. As soon as I realized I could get away with being high in class it became my new normal. Five years of my life are lost in a haze. We were not engaged.

Looking back, more than 20 years of our life, looked like a massive region of academic boredom punctuated with only a few useful highlights. Something like this:

Surely we learned something valuable? All that time was working towards something wasn't it?

No, not really.

There were definitely important teachers and subjects. There is no doubt that school offered a few diamonds in the rough. Even more valuable are the key relationships we remember. Learning to socialize is critical for everyone's development. But did it need to take 20 years? No. Did it have a big impact on where we are today? No. Memory selects for frequency and recency. It is telling that we forget almost everything we learned in the standard curriculum. I made it to second year university mathematics as part of my physics studies because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. Today, I can barely do long division. Studying hard in school then going to university did nothing for getting us a good job. I discovered a meaningful career in tech through self study and a return to college as an adult. Amanda never found a fulfilling career from school but discovered meaning as a mother and leader of our children's education.

Most of our intellectual highlights are from our own readings and conversations with friends. Something we did outside of school hours.
