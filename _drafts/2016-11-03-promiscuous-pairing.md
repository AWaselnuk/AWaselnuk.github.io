On July 5, 2016 I had the honour of speaking on stage at Shopify’s annual UX Summit. My talk was called ‘promiscuous pairing’ 
and it was about pairing across disciplines in UX. Read on for an abstract, a video recording of the talk, and a script.

## Abstract

At the scale of Shopify, it makes sense to split the UX team into discrete, specialized disciplines. 
The downside is that these disciplines - Design, Front End Development, Research, Content - communicate less directly in their daily work. 
We’ll discuss how we can adopt some ‘pairing’ principles in our UX work to ship faster, ship better, and improve collaboration. 
You’ll learn new ways to work with others, gain empathy for other disciplines, and grow your ‘T’ in the world of Shopify UX.

TODO video!

## Script

As part of the Shopify UX team, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve my craft. 
My craft is how I communicate with the world, how I help solve problems at Shopify. It is a pillar of my identity. 

So I have explored a lot of different formats for growing my craft. Formats like:

* College
* Online video courses
* In-person workshops
* Podcasts
* Books and blog posts galore!

But recently, my exploration has taken me into less charted territory. As we develop our craft, 
I believe we need to start thinking laterally, and start discovering lessons in new places. 
One technique has me excited more than any book or online course ever has before.

In the engineering world it is called ‘pair programming’. This technique has proven so valuable to that 
craft that entire companies do *all* programming time in pairs. Any work they produce is produced by a pair.

We should pay attention to such a phenomenon! There is clearly something to this and, if we can understand the basic ideas 
of pairing, we can leverage them across UX.

I believe pairing will accelerate growth in our craft, challenge the way we think about solving problems, and connect us 
with all of the talented people in our UX team.

Today I am going to talk about *UX* pairing.

Because pairing is not just a weird ritual for developers. *Pairing is co-creation.* It is two minds working 
together to create one thing. In pairs we can do the kind of work we would usually do alone, for example: wireframes, 
interview questions, or programming.

It may sound simple, but I believe that we will see massive growth in our craft if we spend more time pairing with 
every UX discipline.

### Outline

To explore this, I’m going to cover why everyone should pair with anyone and how to get started with pairing.

* Everyone should pair with any discipline (promiscuous pairing)
* How to get started with pairing
  * Select a problem
  * Know the roles
  * Communicate

### Everyone should pair with any discipline (promiscuous pairing)

At Shopify when we talk about craft growth we talk about being ‘T-shaped’. 
This means that our skill sets should range across a variety of areas but in a few, focused areas, 
our skills should be highly developed. 

The top of the T is hard to develop. We organize ourselves by discipline at Shopify. Being a generalist is not something
we talk about a lot as a company or as an industry. This makes sense because it would be harder to sell a course called 
‘how to do everything better’.

But it doesn’t have to be hard. The people that will make us skilled generalists are sitting in this very room.

When we pair with other UX disciplines we:

* Absorb a bit of their skill set every time we interact.
* See specialists in their element and gain respect and empathy for what they do.
* Gain the confidence to get shit done when a specialist is not available. Everyone here can be confident
shipping code to production, running interviews, or using Sketch.

So right now you might be thinking: “pairing all the time is going to slow me down”.
Or you might be worried about pairing with a discipline you know very little about. 
“A researcher pairing with a front end developer? That’s nuts!" But consider the following:

* We are all here to learn. We have a culture of learning and we admire that need in each other.
* Pairing allows for continual review and QA. Things do go a little slower in the creation stage but they need less revision later. Your pair has got your back.
* Social pressure totally works! Pairs can keep each other accountable to produce great work. Book a pairing room with someone and I guarantee you will get that work done.
* We can easily organize things to be reciprocated. A pair can work on one project for 45 minutes, then switch to another. We will all make concrete progress on our work.

### How to get started

Here is how we can get started with UX pairing.

#### Select a problem

When we pair, we should be aiming to produce a real, tangible thing. Here are some examples of jobs that would be great to pair on:

* Create a short survey to find out what people thought about the UX Summit. (research + any)
* Create a real prototype of a new marketing page. (FED + any)
* Add a new section to the Voice and Tone Styleguide. (content + any)
* Design a user flow for a mobile signup process. (design + any)

To get even more out of the pairing session, let’s select a thing that we are stuck on. Our partner’s perspective will likely unblock us!

To clarify: pairing is not a brainstorming session. Going in we should have high level things figured out. We want to get straight into the weeds.
 
Pairing is not a peer review session. We aren’t going to our partners with a finished concept and asking for feedback.
We should not have all the answers going in. We will find the path and create the thing together.

Pairing is co-creation. So let’s select a specific, shippable thing to work on.

#### Know the roles

There are two main roles in a pairing session: the Driver and the Navigator.

The Driver focuses on implementation. This is the person who probably has their hands on a keyboard or mouse and is putting work on a screen.
The focus is on output. Are you staying focused on what is right in front of you? Are you crafting the product swiftly and accurately so that the pair can move on to the next part? 
As Driver, you don’t worry about the big picture as much.

The Navigator focuses on the big picture and the quality. The Navigator watches for problems and keeps and eye towards the larger goal. 
Is the work the pair is producing solving the problem at hand and is it of suitable quality? As Navigator you should be thinking about direction to go next.
Help keep the driver focused and away from distractions.

It is normal, and encouraged, for pairs to switch roles regularly in one pairing session. To start, we can try switching every 30 minutes or so. Each person should be aware of what role they are currently in. 
We don’t want to step on each others toes.

#### Communicate

The hardest part of pairing is communication. We have to get used to literally thinking out loud.

As Drivers, we should communicate our approach. We should verbally describe to our pair what we are seeing and where we want to go next. 
It is okay to mention when you are stuck on something.

* “I think we already covered this but I want to finish this section before we go back and review.”
* “I am seeing some issues here so I am going to start cleaning those up.”
* “I am not sure where to go next.”
* “I need a little more time to finish up this part.”

As Navigators, we should communicate the overall vision and ask some tough questions. We should offer guidance when the Driver is stuck.

* “We should complete this section soon and then move on. Redoing all of this other stuff can be tackled later in another sprint.”
* “Let’s pause for a minute here and explore an alternative.”
* “I think I saw an existing solution for this three pages back.”
* “You forgot a semicolon.”

Sometimes pairs will be unbalanced. One person will have a deeper knowledge about the subject than the other person. This is okay — we can learn to communicate with empathy.

As a more experienced person we can think of the work as our ‘hometown’. What can we do to make our guest more comfortable? Perhaps we could point out some of the interesting sights? 
Let’s provide them with a map of the area.

We can use role switching to our advantage. We can let the less experienced person be Driver on the parts they understand. We can have them navigate on the parts they aren’t as familiar with 
while we verbalize our approach to them.

If we make a habit of pairing we will learn to communicate with greater clarity and compassion.

### In conclusion

As I explored UX growth through the lens of pairing, it occured to me that no matter what our specialty is, we all have
more to learn about UX but we also have a tremendous amoutn of knowledge to share with each other. I believe pairing is an impactful way to transfer that knowledge
while getting shit done.

If we spend more time pairing with each other, regardless of discipline, we will develop a deeper understanding of our craft and 
we will share that understanding with others.

So turn to the person sitting beside you, start nodding with determination, and ask them: “will you pair with me?”
