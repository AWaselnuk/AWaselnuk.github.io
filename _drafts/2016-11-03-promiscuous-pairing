On July 5, 2016 I had the honour of speaking on stage at Shopify’s annual UX Summit. My talk was called ‘promiscuous pairing‘ 
and it was about pairing across disciplines in UX. Read on for an abstract, a video recording of the talk, and a script.

## Abstract

At the scale of Shopify, it makes sense to split the UX team into discrete, specialized disciplines. 
The downside is that these disciplines - Design, FED, Research, Content - communicate less directly in their daily work. 
We’ll discuss how we can adopt some ‘pairing’ principles in our UX work to ship faster, ship better, and improve collaboration. 
You’ll learn new ways to work with others, gain empathy for other disciplines, and grow your ‘T’ in the world of Shopify UX.

## Script

As part of the Shopify UX team, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve my craft. 
My craft is how I communicate with the world, how I help solve problems at Shopify. It is a pillar of my identity. 

So I have explored a lot of different formats for growing my craft. Formats like:

* College
* Online video courses
* In-person workshops
* Podcasts
* Books and blog posts galore!

But recently, my exploration has taken me into less charted territory. As we develop our craft, 
I believe we need to start thinking laterally, and start discovering lessons in new places. 
One technique has me excited more than any book or online course ever has before.

In the engineering world it is called ‘pair programming’. This technique has proven so valuable to that 
craft that entire companies do *all* programming time in pairs. Any work they produce is produced by a pair.

We should pay attention to such a phenomenon! There is clearly something to this and if we can understand the basic ideas 
of pairing we can leverage them across UX.

I believe pairing will accelerate growth in our craft, challenge the way we think about solving problems, and connect us 
with all of the talented people in our UX team.

Today I am going to talk about *UX* pairing.

Because pairing is not just a weird ritual for developers. *Pairing is co-creation.* It is two minds working 
together to create one thing. In pairs we can do the kind of work we would usually do alone, for example: wireframes, 
interview questions, or programming.

It may sound simple, but I believe that we will see massive growth in our craft if we spend more time pairing with 
every UX discipline.
