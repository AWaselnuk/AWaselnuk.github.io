## Some Background

In late 2014, I noticed a trend in the front end developer community: there was talk of this magic power called functional reactive programming. As it goes, I started sensing enough of a buzz that I became curious. One of the catalysts that really spiked my interest in the topic was [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gawmdhCNy-A) from Jafar Husain at Netflix. Functional and functional reactive programming sounded intriguing and they seemed to have really interesting applications for user interface design.

I was really looking to grow as a programmer so in early 2015 I decided to learn a new programming language. I wanted it to be a functional one and I settled on Elixir because it seemed to take a lot of inspiration from Ruby which I know and love. Elixir excels at building distributed, fault tolerant servers. This put me in a situation where I was tackling 3 big things: a new programming paradigm, a new language, and a new problem space. It went badly.

Elixir was a delight. I learned a lot going through some basics but my pace was at a crawl. I was trying to squeeze too much into too little time. In the summer of 2015 I decided to try a different approach so I switched to learning Elm. Elm excels at building user interfaces which is a problem space I am quite familiar with. This brought me down to 2 big things: a new programming paradigm, and a new language.

Elm has been a lot of fun but still a big challenge and a great opportunity for growth. I continue to learn it and am working productively towards building a non trivial thing with it. I plan to write some more focused blog posts about Elm soon.

There was still a ton to understand about functional programming as a concept. Studying Elm was helping but I craved more. So just before Christmas I took a Front End Masters course called “Hardcore Functional Progamming in JavaScript”. Beyond having a title that makes me feel like a badass, the course allowed me to leverage my knowledge of JavaScript and narrow my focus to one thing: the functional programming paradigm.

For the rest of this article I will talk about what I believe functional programming is all about, some of the concepts covered in that course, and my next steps for learning functional programming.
