My thoughts are not my own.

For many years now, I've been a glutton for information. Books, podcasts, blog posts, newsfeeds, videos, are all relaying information at an ever increasing pace and I am eagerly devouring it, cramming more than I need into my head. More than is good for me.

In the retail food industry, retailers have learned to put the most sugary foods in the most visible places. Tech media companies are employing similar tactics in the digital realm, [gaming our attention]() by filling our sightlines with emotionally provocative content. This exacerbates my problem. As the content grows, and the medium becomes more frictionless, it gets harder and harder to turn away. Our thoughts are the product of what we pay attention to, and my attention feels pulled in many directions. I feel less and less original, and more and more a mouthpiece for the ideas of others who have figured out how the algorithms work.

I need to regain some ground. I want my thoughts to become more generative and less derivative. I want to recover the ability to grow bored. I want to ensure the information I consume is guided more by the quality of the source and my own intentions, and less by what's interesting that day to the algorithms on the internet.

My information diet will have two core components:

1. **Restriction.** Reduce the amount of information I consume, across all media. Give my mind space to reflect on what it already contains, go deeper, and generate my own ideas.
2. **Curation.** When I do consume information, it should be vetted. I will ensure that I more strongly favour works that directly invigorate my actions, have the blessing of trusted thinkers, or the blessing of consistent reviews over time.

## Core 1: Restriction

### The age of abundance

We live in an age of abundant information. In an age of abundance, the risk is not starvation, but overconsumption. We can see this in the physical world: [this graph of obesity in the US projects the rate of obesity in adults to reach 48.9% in 2030, up from 42% in 2020](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2020/01/06/obesity-charts).

The same risk applies to our mind. We devour more and more information with no thought towards how much consumption is optimal. The more time you spend consuming, the less time you spend producing. When all you do is read, watch, and listen, you leave no time to reflect, engage, and create.

My approach to information restriction is simple. The largest source of distracting information is the internet, and the clearest path to the internet is my iphone. To restrict my information input, I will simply restrict access to my phone. Specifically, I plan to keep it in a drawer before my work day starts (around 9) and after my work day ends (around 6).

### Clearing the slate

We have so much cruft saved up that we think we will get back to. These saved articles are a drag on our minds and likely a source of distracting information.

I will delete all my saved Pocket articles.

Who are we kidding? We will never read all of our saved articles and open tabs. Conquer your FOMO and clear the slate.

## Core 2: Curation

Geothe provides a great strategy for curation. I am an extremely curious person. This is generally a positive trait but it has a downside: I read all sorts of books to learn stuff "Just In Case".

### "Just In Time" learning

Rather than reading all sorts of things that might be useful someday, I want to go deep on the areas of interest that matter to my work right now. It is time for me to better understand marketing, customer development, and hypothesis testing. I will make sure to fill my reading list with books that pertain to those topics, rather than get distracted by an interesting book on a topic that is far in my future.
