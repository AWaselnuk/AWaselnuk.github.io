Now that I have [quit my job to build a business](https://www.adamwaselnuk.com/2020/08/27/into-the-unknown-leaving-shopify-to-build-a-business.html), I have lined up the first two projects I will bring into the world.

They are failproof projects.

## Bringing back bestiaries by cutting scope

I have always loved bestiaries. [A bestiary is a book of beasts](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/medieval-world/judaism-christianity-in-art/christianity-art/a/the-bestiary) that catalogues real and imaginary animals. It describes the animals and includes stories about them that often embed a moral lesson. You might be more familiar with the more modern form: [The Monster Manual for Dungeons and Dragons.](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual) Bestiaries were popular in Europe in the Middle Ages. Lately, they have fallen out of style. I'm bringing them back.

Last summer, while on paternity leave, I wanted to start a new side project. I thought to myself: What would a modern take on a bestiary look like? Could I catalogue every known imaginary creature from both ancient and modern sources? How would I even organize such a collection? The idea compelled me but there was a serious problem. The vision was so BIG. As a full-time employed father of 3, how was I going to catalogue all those creatures?

I began looking for a way to slash scope while preserving the most important parts of the idea. I made the decision to launch the project as a newsletter that would release 1 new creature per week. This would allow me to make progress on the idea, one creature at a time. As I went I would satisfy my curiosity about mythology. It was a commitment I believed I could keep. I built the website in 1 day and started asking people to subscribe. ([_I also explain these origins in a YouTube video if you prefer that format._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWOX0W_zz4A))

I call the project [Novus Bestiary](https://www.novusbestiary.com), which is latin for "the new bestiary". It is my first taste of a failproof project. I am fulfilled if no one ever signed up. I would go on writing these stories for myself, one entry at a time.

As it turns out, people _did_ sign up. This spring I made the decision to evolve it from a newsletter into a full-featured website. The new website will launch in a few weeks when the final cover illustrations are ready.

## You meet at an inn...

To introduce my second project, I'll rewind the clock a little further.

There is an old project of mine that has lived on in my heart for years. It was the first thing I ever built by myself as a web developer. [Here Be Taverns](http://www.herebetaverns.com) generates random fantasy taverns. When you are running a game of Dungeons & Dragons and your players walk off the scripted path, kick open the door of a building you just invented on the spot and _demand_ the name of the owner: you need an answer.

I [wrote about it](https://www.adamwaselnuk.com/project/2015/03/28/here-be-taverns.html) in 2015, around the time I released it. Looking back on that post now is cringe-worthy. It is a window into a much less competent version of myself. But, even today, that project has managed to continue teaching me lessons. **Sometimes, when you are stuck on what to do with your future, you can examine your past to find meaning.**

When I got stuck on what to build next, I tried looking back at what I had built before. I searched my memories for the ones that brought the most emotional resonance. Your body reveals the truth â€“ you want to find the thoughts that give you goosebumps. What I found was that so many of my most treasured memories revolved around fantasy books. I found something important in myself that I want to bring out and share with the world.

I also focused on _action_. Where did I actually spend time in the past? Here Be Taverns stood out. It was the only time I had ever brought a side project to the finish line. Something about it compelled me.

## ...which was procedurally generated

What other treasures await in my past?

I have had an interest in Procedural Content Generation for years. It is a technique that allows you to generate infinite amounts of random content based on a small set of programmatic rules. Games like Minecraft use this to generate beautiful landscapes. This is an area of interest that I have been following from the sidelines but never acted on.

It strikes me that Here Be Taverns is a perfect opportunity to explore this topic. And so I have the second failproof project. After I ship Novus Bestiary, I will begin building Here Be Taverns: V2. I already have some initial customer research and a set of features planned out.

_Sidenote: If PCG peaks your interest, you should start with [this talk by Kate Compton](https://youtu.be/WumyfLEa6bU), and then check out [this oldschool wiki](http://pcg.wikidot.com/), [and the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/)_

## A business plan

**My goal is to launch these two projects by the end of this year. You can hold me accountable to that deadline.** Besides the benefits outlined above, they will give me a concrete way to learn more about marketing. I will also get a chance to connect with an audience I want to serve.

The plan is to build up these two assets, grow traffic to both sites, and grow my audience. After that, I will decide on a third project. I will address it to the same audience to continue the compounding effect. I will use the first two projects as paths that point people towards the next thing. If the third project offers enough value, I will charge money for it. In this way, I will attempt my first entrepreneurial goal: [Make \$1 on the internet.](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1301515355622383618?s=20)

How can this plan fail?

If there is little response to these projects, I will not have failed, I will have learned something. I will have developed skills I need. I will have learned more about what people like. I will have developed relationships with my audience. In every future I will continue to learn and build.

These are failproof projects.
