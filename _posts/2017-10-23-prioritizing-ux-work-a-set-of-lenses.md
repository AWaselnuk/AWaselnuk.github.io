  Welcome to Shopify!

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * This is a story about my career progression as a UXer at Shopify which also happens to be a story about priorities.
    * Describe how I felt starting at the company and the environment of autonomy and ownership.

<section>
  What should I work on?

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * This is a hard question because time is your most precious resource.
    * Where to spend your limited time is a difficult problem to solve, but we can look at some strategies to make things easier and increase our impact.
    * As we go through these strategies I will be asking you some questions in the hopes that we all learn from your experiences too.

  <h3>The Lens of Quality</h3>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Early in my career and this is what I knew best.
    * This is all about finding quality issues and improving them.
    * Focus on the weakest parts of the experience and the product will improve!

  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Easy to spot opportunities.</li>
    <li>We are already good at this.</li>
    <li>Adds polish and delight.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Might not really matter.</li>
    <li>Might drive us insane.</li>
    <li>Users might not really care. (gasp!)</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="/img/presentations/prioritizing-ux-work/facebook-crossposting-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the crossposting settings page from Facebook">

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Some confusing text about crossposting
    * Some pretty random spacing and a small text box (compare to how fun it is to type in news feed)
    * No one is losing sleep over this
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Users might not really care. *</h3>
  <p>* <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ping_Zhang24/publication/2560629_User_Expectations_and_Rankings_of_Quality_Factors_in_Different_Web_Site_Domains/links/0c960524316506f697000000.pdf">Actually it's complicated</a></p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Quality expectations change over time. Kano model is a way to think about this.
    * Basic, performance, exciting. Don't worry about exciting until basics are done.
    * Don't worry about exciting if you don't even know what the product should do yet.
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-background-color="#ffc043">
  <p>How did you decide what to work on when you first started at your current job?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Quality and polish is generally improving but …</p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * I was trapped by physical constraints like time
    * I felt there must be a way to have more impact
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>The Lens of Leverage</h3>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Started to ask myself: how can I do more? What lever can I apply?
    * Decided to start hiring a team.
    * This is all about looking for ways you can achieve more with the same amount of time.
    * In my experience it often involves the "people" systems but it doesn't have to. (ie. docs, tools, teams)
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <img src="/img/presentations/prioritizing-ux-work/impact-effort-matrix.jpg" alt="A matrix of impact vs effort">
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Higher impact for same amount of time.</li>
    <li>Think outside the box of your physical boundaries.</li>
    <li>Work through your team to achieve more.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Harder to spot.</li>
    <li>Can be hard to execute.</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * A lot of high leverage work involves coordinating humans.
    * Examples: building a brand or design system.
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-background-color="#ffc043">
  <p>Have you found any levers you can apply recently?</p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Get the ball rolling by talking about the coding work I did recently for partner brand and how it was an anti-lever
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <p>So now I have a team. What should <i>we</i> work on?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>The Lens of Product</h3>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * I started to wonder more about this word 'product'. It seemed something was in the air.
    * We have product managers at Shopify and that seemed interesting.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote>
    As I’ve moved along with this I’ve noticed that learning about product management has sort of ballooned into learning about product management, business, and people in the work environment. This is fine.
  </blockquote>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Pulled from a google doc I wrote called "What the heck is product?"
    * As you can tell, this turned out to be a deep topic. I learned a TON about priorities and other things.
    * I want to share one small tool we use at Shopify
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Experiment</h3>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">You aren't sure what the right thing is. Optimize for learning.</p>
  <h3>Feature</h3>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">You are clear about the problem you are solving. Optimize for value.</p>
  <h3>Infrastructure (Platform)</h3>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">You are clear about a solution. Optimize for future possibilities.</p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * The idea is to categorize your project as a team into one of these three streams.
    * Also think about risk. If impact of failure is high it defaults to Infrastructure or you figure out how to mitigate.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Experiment/Feature/Infrastructure gives your team a common language.</li>
    <li>Group prioritization rather than individual.</li>
    <li>Lot's more to learn about product management.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <p>Lot's more to learn about product management. It can be a full time job!</p>
</section>

<section data-background-color="#ffc043">
  <p>Have you ever worked with a product manager or read about it? What did you learn?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The team is shipping projects and there is still lots to learn. But what do I <i>really want?</i></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>The Lens of Self</h3>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * Working through this right now
    * Leading a team is challenging, many people want your time and attention.
    * There is a challenge for all of us in this room - the world is full of possibilities so how do we choose?
    * Most important prioritization tool. Also the most difficult.

<section>
  <img width="400px" src="/img/presentations/prioritizing-ux-work/essentialism-book.jpg" alt="Cover of the book 'Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less' by Greg McKeown">
  <p>Do less, but better.</p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * I had already developed this philosophy but reading this was like a bolt of lightning.
    * The idea is one I truly believe in: Do less, but better.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <p>You own your priorities. No one else.</p>
  <p>Apply a very selective criteria for what is essential.</p>
  <p>Set a clear goal. Make the decision that makes a thousand decisions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Improve my communication skills.</p>
  <p><strong>Speak at the 2017 HamOnt UX conference and get invited back.</strong></p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * It's scary because you make your conditions for failure clear
    * The power of essentialism isn't just about setting goals. It's all of the techniques that help you focus and prioritize.
    * Taking ownership of your time, saying no gracefully, being selective.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <p>It's the most important and powerful lens in my opinion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <p>It's terrifying. It can lead to massive change.</p>
</section>

<section data-background-color="#ffc043">
  <p>Take a minute and write down a goal.</p>
  <p>Exactly where do you want to be in 3 years from now?</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">Too hard? Don't worry – try 1 year.</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">6 months</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">1 month</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">1 week</p>
  <p class="fragment fade-up">Tomorrow</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>It's not easy to prioritize.</p>
  <p>But we can look at the problem through different lenses.</p>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
    * I encourage you to try out all the lenses on your current challenges.
    * I encourage you to think more deliberately about where you spend your most precious resource.
    * Most of all, I encourage you to decide where it is you want to be and to orient yourself towards that goal. Not only your “users” but every human in the world around you will benefit from that.
