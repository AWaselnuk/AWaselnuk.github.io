title: "Introducing the wbb.fm podcast"
---

After going out on my own to build a business, I started doing a weekly call with my brother [Brandon](). I noticed that every time we spoke I got a ton of value out of the conversations. Brandon knows a lot about building businesses and possesses many strengths that I am lacking. We compliment each other very well.

Finally I asked him: "should we be recording these conversations?". We agreed, and our new podcast was born.

Check out [Wazel Brothers Build](https://wbb.fm "wbb.fm - A podcast about bootstrapped tech businesses") if you want an honest and personal look at our businesses each week. I truly believe you will learn something along with us!

The podcast should be available on all the major distribution channels within a few days.
